track hours spent cherishing wikipedia

### in this house we use use pride versioning
right now we're at 0.1

when i make a release im proud of (the initial release) i'll bump it to 1.0

when we release a new feature or an improvement not worthy of bumping the real version, we'll change to 1.1 (i'm not doing 0.x fuck that)

when we just fix bugs we bump to 1.0.x
