BUGS
	fix it running on non-wikipedia sites
		i think this has something to do with chrome://extensions/
		it has nothing to do with chrome:// urls. this runs fucking anywhere
		i think it's when we switch tabs we do absolutely no checking if we're actually on wikipedia.
		i don't know though, i haven't looked at the code since i wrote it.
		(DONE) maybe filter out non-wikipedia sites from the db

FEATURES
	figure out what to put for the title! it just doesn't look right without it!
		probably like wiki, wrapped or something
