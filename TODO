BUGS
	fix new tab behavior.
		when opening a page in a new tab, the link nav event is fired and we start counting for that page.
		we should instead detect that, and ignore the event.
	fix it running on non-wikipedia sites
		i think this has something to do with chrome://extensions/
		it has nothing to do with chrome:// urls. this runs fucking anywhere
		i think it's when we switch tabs we do absolutely no checking if we're actually on wikipedia.
		i don't know though, i haven't looked at the code since i wrote it.
		maybe filter out non-wikipedia sites from the db
	(DONE) fix the counter, right now it's only showing time spent today. that's not right.
		this should be fixed im just leaving this here cause i don't trust i did it right
	fix the counter doubling on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Monarch_of_the_Glen,_Edwin_Landseer,_1851.png
		i suspect this is from totaling the previous values and still including today's

FEATURES
	figure out what to put for the title! it just doesn't look right without it!
		probably like wiki, wrapped or something
