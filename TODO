BUGS
    fix new tab behavior.
        when opening a page in a new tab, the link nav event is fired and we start counting for that page.
        we should instead detect that, and ignore the event.
    fix it running on non-wikipedia sites
        i think this has something to do with chrome://extensions/
    maybe filter out non-wikipedia sites from the db
FEATURES
    (DONE) add a fancy bar chart for the extension popup
    track dates an article was visited and time spent on those dates, like this:
        total: 30min, jan 21st: 15min, feb 2: 7 min, feb 14: 8 min
        show this when you click on one of the bars on the chart
