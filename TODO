BUGS
    fix new tab behavior.
        when opening a page in a new tab, the link nav event is fired and we start counting for that page.
        we should instead detect that, and ignore the event.
    fix it running on non-wikipedia sites
        i think this has something to do with chrome://extensions/
	it has nothing to do with chrome:// urls. this runs fucking anywhere
	i think it's when we switch tabs we do absolutely no checking if we're actually on wikipedia.
	i don't know though, i haven't looked at the code since i wrote it.
    maybe filter out non-wikipedia sites from the db
    fix the counter, right now it's only showing time spent today. that's not right.
    	this should be fixed im just leaving this here cause i don't trust i did it right
FEATURES
	add the info page in the popup
		show total time spent, and time spent on certain days. show another bar chart? i dunno
		maybe show the most time spent per day
